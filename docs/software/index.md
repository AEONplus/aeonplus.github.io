## AEON+ related software tools

AEON+ collaborators have produced a number of free, open-source software tools to enable both 
observatory operators to become AEON-compatible, and astronomers to make the most of AEON-capable facilities
for their research.  

### Open Observatory Control Software
LCOGT developed a full suite of Observatory Control Software in order to operate its world-wide network of 
optical telescopes.  This software is now available as a stand-alone package that can be installed and configured for 
any optical observatory. The observatory does not become part of the LCO Network, and remains independent, but the 
package include's LCO's unique scheduling software for other facilities to take advantage of for their 
own use. Naturally, this package is highly compatible with AEON, and the TOM Toolkit, and facilities 
taking advantage of this software can easily opt to participate with AEON if they wish.

More information about the Open Observatory Control System can be found <a href="https://observatorycontrolsystem.github.io/">here</a>.

### The TOM Toolkit
Target and Observation Managers (TOM systems, AKA marshalls) are designed to help as researchers manage 
astronomical programs, and especially to handle their observations.  TOM systems can harvest information 
on new or known targets from alert brokers and data archives, providing a flexible database, user interface
and data visualization tools aimed at astronomical research.  TOMs enable researchers to compose and submit 
requests for observations to any AEON-compatible telescope at the click of a button, and can even be 
automated for highly responsive follow-up.  

The TOM Toolkit is an open-source package designed to make it easy for astronomers to build and customize
a TOM system for their research program.  More information about the TOM Toolkit can be found 
<a href="https://lco.global/tomtoolkit/">here</a>.

### AEONlib [under development]
AEONlib will provide a stand-alone Python library to enable users to submit observing requests from any 
software platform that they chose.
