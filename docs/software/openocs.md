### Open Observatory Control Software
LCOGT developed a full suite of Observatory Control Software in order to operate its world-wide network of 
optical telescopes.  This software is now available as a stand-alone package that can be installed and configured for 
any optical observatory. The observatory does not become part of the LCO Network, and remains independent, but the 
package include's LCO's unique scheduling software for other facilities to take advantage of for their 
own use. Naturally, this package is highly compatible with AEON, and the TOM Toolkit, and facilities 
taking advantage of this software can easily opt to participate with AEON if they wish.
