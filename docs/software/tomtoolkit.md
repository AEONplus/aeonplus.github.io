### The TOM Toolkit
Target and Observation Managers (TOM systems, AKA marshalls) are designed to help as researchers manage 
astronomical programs, and especially to handle their observations.  TOM systems can harvest information 
on new or known targets from alert brokers and data archives, providing a flexible database, user interface
and data visualization tools aimed at astronomical research.  TOMs enable researchers to compose and submit 
requests for observations to any AEON-compatible telescope at the click of a button, and can even be 
automated for highly responsive follow-up.  

The TOM Toolkit is an open-source package designed to make it easy for astronomers to build and customize
a TOM system for their research program.  More information about the TOM Toolkit can be found
