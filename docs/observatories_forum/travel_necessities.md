# Travel Necessities

A couple of necessary formalities for visitors from outside the US:

### Health Insurance

All visitors are required to have proof of health insurance when visiting the USA. Most travel insurance 
companies provide suitable plans.

### Entry visas

The US has a visa waiver scheme for nationals of 42 countries, but eligible people still need to apply for an 
[ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/) BEFORE they travel.
Other nationalities will need to apply for visas.

Please see the US Department of State's official website for accurate travel information, and bear in mind the 
application process can take time.

Some participants may require a written invitation to the meeting for these purposes. If this is the case, 
please contact the Local Organizing Committee via rstreet [at] lco.global as soon as possible.
