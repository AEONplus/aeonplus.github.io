The museum has free on-site parking within easy walking distance.  

## Getting to the meeting rooms
To the right of the parking lot you will see the skeleton of a whale; please enter the museum through 
iron gates just to the right of this landmark, rather than through the public entrance.  Continue straight 
through the main concourse and turn right at the fountain.  

Plenary sessions will be held in Farrand Hall, and breakout sessions will be in the neighboring classrooms.
