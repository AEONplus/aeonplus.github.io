# Speaker Instructions
Please upload your talk slides **at least one session ahead** of the session where you will speak. 
The URL for the shared drive is bookmarked on the Slack channel #obsforum2025.  

Please also come to the podium during the break to ensure that your talk displays properly - 
this is particularly important if you have movies or sound during your presentation.  We 
plan to use a single laptop throughout the workshop, which can support Keynote, Powerpoint, Google slides, 
LibreOffice and other common formats.
