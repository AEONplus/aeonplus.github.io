## Rapid, flexible, programmable access to multi-wavelength telescope facilities

<p>AEON+ is a collaboration between astronomical telescopes to enable more responsive, flexible modes of 
observations that are essential for time domain astrophysics.  </p>
<p>Alerts of new, often transient, survey discoveries can only be properly characterized by follow-up 
observations obtained rapidly in response. This requires a paradigm shift in the operations of most 
astronomical telescope facilities towards two key capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests for observations submitted programmatically</li>
<li>Flexible modes of executing the requested observations</li>
</ul>

<p>Building on the success of the original AEON Collaboration between Las Cumbres Observatory, 
the NSF's Optical/Infrared Laboratory and the SOAR 4.1m and Gemini 8m telescopes, the AEON+ program 
is expanding these capabilities to a broader range of facilities, and wavelengths.
