# Observatories Forum

## Sept 23-25, 2025         &#10209;        Santa Barbara, CA

The Observatories Forum is a workshop series designed to bring together developers and engineers from different 
facilities spanning a range of wavelengths, with developers from the science community.  The goal is to share 
experience, tools, challenges and plans, particularly those associated with enabling time domain and multi-messenger 
astrophysics.
