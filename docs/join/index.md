## Joining AEON+
The AEON+ network will become increasing effective for astrophysics as new facilities of all 
apertures and wavelengths become compatible, so we welcome the chance to work with other observatories.  

The practical requirements for AEON-compatibility are minimal.  An observatory needs to:
<ol>
<li>provide a programmatically-accessible software portal that enables users to submit observation requests</li>
<li>conduct the requested observations in queue-scheduled mode at least some of the time</li>
</ol>

The AEON+ Collaboration has developed a number of free, open-source software tools which observatories 
are welcome - though not required - to use to meet these requirements.  

Equally important, a number of things are <italic>NOT</italic> required to become AEON-compatible:
<ol>
<li>No requirements are placed on the eligibility for, or allocation of, telescope time on any 
facility.  This remains under the sole control of each observatory</li>
<li>The telescope does not have to be robotically operated or automated.  Observatories are free to 
conduct observations according to their preferred operations workflow.  </li>
<li>The observatory/instrument control software does not have to be changed.  AEON-compatibility only 
requires software to communicate observation requests from users to the facility; how the facility executes 
the requests it receives is up to the observatory operator</li>
</ol>

If your facility is interested in getting involved, please reach out to
