The aptly-named International Gemini Observatory operates twin 8-m optical/near-infrared telescopes from 
Maunakea on the Big Island of Hawaii and Cerro Pachón in Chile, providing full sky coverage in declination and 
6 hours of difference in longitude. Gemini North is a neighbor of AEON+ facility CFHT and Gemini South shares 
Cerro Pachón with SOAR and the Vera C Rubin Observatory. Gemini is a founding member of AEON along with Las 
Cumbres Observatory and SOAR.

Each telescope is equipped with optical and near-infrared imagers, medium resolution optical and near-infrared 
spectrographs, and optical high-resolution spectrographs. Gemini North also has the Altair near-infrared 
adaptive-optics system with laser guide star. Up to three instruments are usable at each telescope on a given 
night and switching between them takes less than a minute. An eight channel instrument, SCORPIO, is under 
construction for Gemini South that will provide simultaneous imaging or longslit spectroscopy from 0.4 to 2.4 
microns. 

Gemini operates in queue mode on the majority of nights. Staff observers match observations to the current 
conditions. New observations, including Targets of Opportunity, are easily inserted into the observing plans. 
Gemini works within AEON using an existing [API](https://github.com/bryanmiller/gsselect) and plugins to the 
[TOM Toolkit](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Software improvements that are 
[under development](https://www.gemini.edu/observing/operations-development) will provide enhanced automation based on 
25 years of queue operations experience, more capable APIs, and a dynamic scheduler that will create 
observing plans for both telescopes together. This system, the Gemini Program Platform (GPP), is expected to 
enter operations in 2026.

The international Gemini Observatory, a program of NSF NOIRLab, is managed by the Association of Universities 
for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. National Science Foundation on 
behalf of the Gemini partnership: the U.S. National Science Foundation (United States), the National Research 
Council (Canada), Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (Chile), Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e 
Innovación (Argentina), Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações (Brazil), and Korea 
Astronomy and Space Science Institute (Republic of Korea).
