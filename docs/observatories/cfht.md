<p>CFHT is a 3.6m optical/infrared telescope located on Maunakea on the island of Hawai’i. One
of the Maunakea Observatories, CFHT is a joint facility of the National Research Council of
Canada (NRC), the National Center for Scientific Research of France (CNRS), and the
University of Hawai’i.</p>

<p>The global partnership that supports CFHT has allowed the observatory to host state-of-the-art
instrumentation and pioneer modern queued service observing and remote night operations.
This suite of instruments consists of MegaCam, a wide-field imager optimized for the near-UV
and optical wavelengths, SPIRou, an infrared spectropolarimeter capable of high radial velocity
accuracy, and ESPaDOnS, an optical high-resolution spectropolarimeter.</p>

<p>These instruments are operated in queued service observing mode, which allows for highly
flexible scheduling of transient and time-critical observations through a ‘target of opportunity’
request capability, in addition to regular, pre-scheduled long-term monitoring and survey
programs.</p>

<p>Science programs at CFHT are managed through the observatory’s custom Kealahou web
application which provides direct worldwide access to observation programming and science
data products. This includes fully reduced science-ready images and spectra, processed in-
house by CFHT’s suite of data reduction pipelines.</p>

<p>Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is located on Maunakea on Hawaiʻi Island, a mountain
of considerable cultural, natural, and ecological significance. Maunakea is a sacred site to
Native Hawaiians, also known as K&#257;naka '&#332;iwi.</p>
