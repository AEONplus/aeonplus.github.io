[NSF NOIRLab](https://noirlab.edu/science/) is the US national center for ground-based, nighttime optical astronomy. Through its five programs - 
[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO)](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio), the 
[Community Science and Data Center (CSDC)](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/csdc), the [International 
Gemini Observatory](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/gemini-observatory), 
[Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO)](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/kpno), and 
[Vera C. Rubin Observatory](http://science) — NOIRLab serves as a 
focal point for community development of innovative scientific programs, the exchange of ideas, and creative 
development. 

Many NOIRLab facilities and projects, including the 4.1-meter SOAR Telescope, the International Gemini 
Observatory, the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope, and the 
[ANTARES Broker system](https://noirlab.edu/public/projects/antares/), are crucial components for 
time domain science in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory era. [NOIRLab participation in the AEON Network](https://noirlab.edu/public/projects/aeon/) 
contributes to an efficient and accessible ecosystem for our communities.

NOIRLab is also encouraging the wider adoption of AEON compatibility through the [Rubin In-Kind Program’s 
contributed telescope facilities](https://www.lsst.org/scientists/in-kind-program/telescope-resources).
