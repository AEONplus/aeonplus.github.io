<p>The W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO) consists of two 10 meter optical/infrared telescopes sitting 
atop Maunakea on the Island of Hawai ªi.</p>

WMKO has an array of imaging and spectroscopic instruments, including integral field, multi-object, 
and high resolution spectrographs. Many of the instruments use the Adaptive Optics system to correct 
for the effects of atmospheric blurring. The current list of available instruments can be found at
[here](https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/).

Observing time is available to members of the communities that make up the Keck partnership. General public 
access is available through the partnership with NASA; more information can be found
[here](https://nexsci.caltech.edu/missions/KeckSolicitation/).

<p>WMKO is a classically scheduled observatory. Each participating community has its own Time Allocation 
Committee that reviews proposals semi-annually and assigns time based on the scientific merit of each proposal. 
Those time assignments are then used to generate the night-by-night schedule for each of the telescopes.  
In addition, Target of Opportunity programs can be approved that allow for the classically scheduled 
observations to be interrupted to conduct science for transient events.</p>

<p>WMKO recognizes and acknowledges the very significant cultural role and reverence that Maunakea has always 
had within the Native Hawaiian community.  The WMKO community is most fortunate to have the opportunity to 
conduct observations from atop Maunakea.</p>
