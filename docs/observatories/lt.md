<p>The Liverpool Telescope is a fully robotic astronomical telescope owned and operated by 
the Astrophysics Research Institute of Liverpool John Moores. <p>
It was designed and built by Telescope Technologies Limited (a spin-off company of the university) 
as the prototype of their production-line range of two-metre class telescopes. It's sited at the 
international Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the summit of the island of La Palma, 
westernmost of the Canaries, some 200 km off the coast of north-west Africa.</p>

<p>The telescope is a two-metre Cassegrain reflector, with Ritchey-Chrétien hyperbolic optics, 
on an alt-azimuth mount. Up to nine different instruments can be mounted at the Cassegrain focus, 
one in the "straight through" position and eight more on side ports accessible by a rotating 
"science fold" tertiary mirror. Over the years a wide variety of optical and near-IR imagers, 
spectrometers, and polarimeters have been mounted on the LT.</p>

<p>The LT concentrates on meeting specific scientific goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid robotic reaction to unpredictable phenomena and their systematic follow-up</li>
<li>Small scale surveys and serendipitous source follow-up</li>
<li>Monitoring of variable objects on all timescales from seconds to years</li>
<li>Simultaneous coordinated observations with other ground and space-based facilities</li>
</ul>
