The Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope is a 4.1 meter aperture telescope designed
to work from the atmospheric cut-off in the blue (320 nm) to the near infrared, with excellent optical
image quality, fast slewing and with a varied suite of instruments always ready for use. SOAR is
funded by a a partnership between [NSF’s NOIRLab (NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy
Research Laboratory)](https://noirlab.edu/public/) formerly the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory - NOAO), on behalf
of the [U.S. National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/), the [Ministério da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovaçoes (MCTI)](http://www.mctic.gov.br/portal) of
the Federal Republic of Brazil, the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)](https://physics.unc.edu/), and [Michigan
State University (MSU)](http://www.pa.msu.edu/). 

The SOAR telescope is [situated on Cerro Pachón](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/telescopes/soar-telescope/about/location) - IV Region - Chile, at an
altitude of 2,700 meters (8,775 feet) above sea level, co-located on the same summit with the [Vera
Rubin](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/vera-c-rubin-observatory) and the [Gemini South Observatories](http://www.gemini.edu/). Our [offices](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/telescopes/soar-telescope/about/location) 
are located in the [AURA](http://www.aura-astronomy.org/)/[CTIO](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio) compound, in
the city of La Serena, Chile. For more information on the technical specifications of the telescope, see
[this page](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/telescopes/soar-telescope/technical-specs).
SOAR is one of the founding partners of the Astronomical Event Observatory Network (AEON),
together with Las Cumbres Observatory and Gemini, and has been running the highly automated
SOAR AEON queue regularly since 2019. AEON at SOAR offers AEON-SOAR optical imaging and
spectroscopy, and near-IR spectroscopy (out to 2.4 um). Starting in the second half of 2025 we will
also be offering near-IR imaging.

In addition to dynamic, programmatically accessible scheduling, AEON on SOAR provides real-time
[optical imaging and spectroscopic data reduction](https://soardocs.readthedocs.io/projects/goodman-pipeline/en/latest/index.html), 
which allows our [Goodman spectrograph](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/instruments/goodman-high-throughput-spectrograph) users to
get fully reduced data seconds after shutter close. The SOAR AEON queue includes an observation of
a spectrophotometric standard star every night. [Tspec](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/instruments/triplespec41-nir-imaging-spectrograph) near-IR spectroscopy in AEON mode include a
Telluric standard observed immediately after the science target.
Users can use the [LCO Observation Portal](https://observe.lco.global/) or an [API](https://developers.lco.global/) to submit targets. All raw and reduced SOAR
data are uploaded to the [Las Cumbres data archive](https://archive.lco.global/), from where users can download their data
products.
